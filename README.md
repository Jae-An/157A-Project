# Rocket Optimization/Sizing Script
## TODO: 
- add material library struct
- implement rand material choice for body tube


Units: FPS

Assumptions/Model:
 - 1 degree of freedom simulation
 - No boattail
 - No base, interference (?) drag
 - Constant thrust + pressure effects
 - Optimizing for weight, not apogee
 - weight contribution of material insignificant to thrust.
