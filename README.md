- implement rand material choice for body tube


Units: FPS

Assumptions/Model:
 - 2 degree of freedom simulation
 - No boattail
 - No protuberance/excrescency drag
 - Constant thrust + pressure effects
 - Optimizing for weight, not apogee
 - Rocket instantaneously turns off rail by angle of attack
